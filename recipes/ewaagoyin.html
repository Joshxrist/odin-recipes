  <p><em><b>"Ewa Agoyin,"</b></em> is mashed steamed beans with pepper sauce.</p>
  <p> Made of honey beans (oloyin), this stew is smokey and rich in flavor, and mashed and crunchy in texture. Some call it a stew, others a sauce, but I think we can all agree it's a delicious, flavorful dish — sort of like a chili — that you'll
    want to mop up with a starchy side like plantains, boiled yam, or bread.</p>

  <h3>Method of Preparation.</h3>
  <p>Before anything, first get your ingredients ready:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ewa Agoyin</li>
    <li>Soak your dried peppers in water till they’re plump, this should take between 2-6 hours, depending on just how dry they are. <em>You can choose to soak overnight if you wish.</em></li>
    <li>When the peppers are plump, add the pepper seeds and just a little bit of water, you can use some of the water they were soaked in, half a cup should do. Add the minced ginger, crayfish and Maggi crayfish, blend coarsely.</li>
    <li>If you don’t like tasting bits in your stews, you can blend smoother, I like mine with bits.</li>
    <li>Set the blended pepper aside. Pick and wash your beans, pour in enough water to cover and cook till tender, do not add any salt till it’s tender. This is so the beans cooks faster. To cut down cooking time, use a pressure cooker if you’ve got
      one.</li>
    <li>While the beans is cooking, get yourself a saucepan, place on a hob on medium heat, add the palm oil and bleach for 10-12 minutes.</li>
    <li>When it’s bleached, turn the heat down to low, add your chopped onions…</li>
    <li>Fry the onions till it begins to burn a little.</li>
    <li> Some leave the onions to burn till it looks all black, this adds to the crunchiness but I prefer it just like this but feel free to let it burn, burn, burn! Also, you may want to use less onions, I LOVE onions hence the exaggerated quantity.
    </li>
    <li>Now add your blended pepper, ground pepper, smoked fish (if you’re using any) and salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Still on low heat, let it fry for at least 40 minutes, stir occasionally so it doesn’t burn.</li>
    <li>You should start to perceive the Agoyin Sauce aroma as soon as the blended pepper is added, if you can’t, then you’ve probably done something wrong at some point.</li>
    <li>It should look like the picture above when it’s fully fried…very dark but definitely not burnt. You should end up with a smoother consistency if you didn’t use as much onions or add whole crayfish like I did.</li>
    <li>Back to the beans! Check on the beans, when it’s tender, add salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Let it continue to boil till very soft…</li>
    <li>When it’s very soft, use a wooden spoon to mash the beans till there’s almost no whole beans in sight. Alternatively, mash it up using a hand mixer…</li>
    <li>Your Ewa Agoyin is ready.</li>
  </ul>
