  <p><em><b>"Efo Riro,"</b></em> which roughly translates to "stirred leafy vegetable," can be made with your meat or fish of choice, and traditionally attains its layered flavor from iru (locust bean) and ground crayfish.</p>
  <p>This recipe, as with many West African recipes, calls for palm oil, a crop that is native to the region. If, for whatever reason, you'd like to use something else, you can try substituting with a different vegetable oil. The recipe will still
    come together, but the taste will be different.</p>
  <P>This Nigerian spinach stew, also called vegetable soup and natively known as <em><b>“Efo Riro”</b></em> is guaranteed to be one of the most savory and delicious spinach recipes you will ever taste!</P>

  <h3>Content</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Spinach</li>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Powdered Dried Shrimp</li>
    <li>Palm oil</li>
    <li>No bouillon cubes</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p>Blend half of the red onion with the tomatoes, bell pepper, garlic, and hot pepper. Chop the other half of the red onion.
    In a deep sauce pan or stock pot, heat the oil and saute the onions over medium heat until its golden brown.</p>
  <p>Add the blended tomato mix, and allow to cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to avoid the mix from burning.
    After 30 minutes, the sauce should be significantly reduced, at this point season it with powdered dry shrimp and salt to taste.</p>
  <p>If cooking with cooked red meat or chicken, add them to the sauce at this point. If using dried mushrooms, re-hydrate and them at this point as well.
    Add the fresh shrimp to the sauce, then add the spinach. At this stage, the spinach may look too much, but allow to sit in the pot for about 1 minute.
    Gently stir the stew and the spinach until the spinach is wilted till about half the its original volume.</p>
  <p>Adjust the seasoning with salt to taste if necessary. At this point I added the fried tilapia, stirred and served.
    This stew is best served warm and freshly cooked.</p>
