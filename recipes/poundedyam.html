  <p><em><b>Pounded Yam</b></em> is one of the Nigerian fufu recipes that is eaten with the various Nigerian soup recipes. The most popular combinations are Pounded Yam with Egusi Soup, Pounded Yam with Nsala or White Soup and many more. Pounded Yam
    is the most stretchy of all the Nigerian fufu recipes that is if it is well prepared. It has the softness of semolina fufu hence it is not as hard as cassava fufu.</p>
  <p>Pounded Yam can be prepared by stirring yam flour in hot water but those who have eaten the one made from scratch with raw yams will tell you that the yam powder method does not do the pounded yam good justice.</p>
  <p><em><b>Egusi</b></em> is the name for the protein-rich seeds of certain cucurbitaceous plants, which after being dried and ground are used as a major ingredient in West African cuisine. Egusi is very high in fat content. It has about 60% fat.
    Talk less of we Yorubas that love adding lots of palm oil to our egusi soup.</p>
  <P>Egusi as stew or soup gives us same great health benefits that help us age slowly. People with dry skin should eat more of egusi soup and egusi stew to help keep their skin soft and moist. Egusi seed is almost the same as sunflower seeds. The
    seeds are light brown. In addition to the fruit that can be consumed, it turns out the seeds can also be consumed.</P>
